This folder contains the matlab file of the LU Factorization algorithm I created at CSU.

Lowerâ€“upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The product sometimes includes a permutation matrix as well.

% luFactor(A)

%	LU decomposition with pivotiing

% inputs:

%	A = coefficient matrix

% outputs:

%	L = lower triangular matrix

%	U = upper triangular matrix

%   P = the permutation matrix
